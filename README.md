#About the Sketcher
I created a simple line sketcher simulator in spring 2017 as part of my final project in a computer science class at Head-Royce School. It utilizes the Java Swing library in order to offer some customization options, while the JOGL is primarily used to handle the canvas drawing. I had never used JOGL before so it was an interesting challenge to learn how to properly utilize its features.

#Sketcher Mechanics

QE to spin

Pointer thickness and color and background color can be changed with the buttons at the bottom

Note: the button outlines will also spin, but where they are supposed to be can still be clicked
Help screen shows on startup and can be accessed again by clicking the bottom left question mark
